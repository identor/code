# Another code repository...
A repository that contains random code written in multiple languages from Python, bash, Java, Prolog, PHP or to some other language that I would be using in the future. This mainly contains archived code mostly from previous school activities, personal projects, and activities from books. To anyone viewing this please feel free to use any code from this repository. I am too lazy to add licenses that I don't even understand...
